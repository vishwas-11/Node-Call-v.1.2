# Node-Call

A real-time video calling and chat web application built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **Socket.io**, **WebRTC**, and **TailwindCSS**.

## Features

* Peer-to-peer video calling using **WebRTC**.
* Real-time chat functionality during video calls.
* Clean and responsive UI powered by **TailwindCSS**.
* Uses **Socket.io** for signaling and real-time messaging.
* Room-based call setup — share room ID to connect.

## Tech Stack

* **Node.js** – Server-side JavaScript runtime.
* **Express.js** – Lightweight web framework for Node.
* **Socket.io** – Enables real-time, bidirectional communication.
* **WebRTC** – Peer-to-peer video and audio communication.
* **TailwindCSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for fast UI development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/node-call.git
   cd node-call
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
4. Open in browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
5. Share the room ID with another user to start a call.

## Folder Structure

```
node-call/
│── public/           # Static assets (HTML, CSS, client JS)
│── src/
│   ├── server.js     # Express and Socket.io server
│   ├── webrtc.js     # WebRTC signaling and logic
│── views/            # HTML templates (e.g., using EJS or plain HTML)
│── package.json      # Project metadata and dependencies
│── README.md         # Project documentation
```

## How It Works

* Users enter a room ID to join a video chat room.
* **Socket.io** handles room creation and signaling.
* **WebRTC** establishes direct peer-to-peer connections.
* Chat messages are exchanged through the same Socket.io connection.
